  This document currently includes a more detailed description of the
  fields used in the MGnifam database. MGnifam entries are composed of 
  two sections, shown in the figure below.

  Header Section:
  ---------------

  The header section mainly contains compulsory fields.  These include
  MGnifam specific information such as accession numbers and identifiers.
  The only non-compulsory field in the header section is the PI field.  
  All the fields in this section are described below.

  AC   Accession number:          MGYPxxxxx

       The MGnifam accession numbers MGYPxxxxx are the stable identifiers 
       for each MGnifam family.
 
  ID   Identification:            15 characters or less

       This field is designed to be a meaningful identifier for the
       family.

       Capitalisation of the first letter will be
       preferred. Underscores are used in place of space, and hyphens
       are only used to mean hyphens.

  DE   Definition:                80 characters or less

       This must be a one line description of the MGnifam family.

  AU   Author:

       Author(s) of the entry.

       The format for this record is shown below. AU lines contain a 
       single author followed by a semi-colon.

       An example of the AU lines from a single entry:

       AU   Bateman A;
       AU   Chothia C;

  BM   HMM building command lines.  

       See the HMMER3 user's manual for full instructions on building
       HMMs. Also see URL:

       http://hmmer.org/

       An example of the BM lines from a single entry
       
       BM   hmmbuild  -o /dev/null HMM SEED
 
  SM   HMM searching command line

       See the HMMER3 user's manual for full instructions on building
       HMMs. Also see URL:

       http://hmmer.org/
     
       An example of the SM line for a family:

       SM   hmmsearch -Z 1024303329 -E 1000 --cpu 16 HMM mgnify

  SE   Source of seed:    

       The source suggesting seed members belong to a family.

  GA   Gathering threshold:   

       Search threshold to build the full alignment.

       GA lines are the thresholds in bits used in the hmmsearch
       command line.  An example GA line is shown below:

       GA   25.00 15.00;

       The order of the thresholds is sequence, domain

       The corresponding hmmsearch command line for the HMM
       would be:

       hmmsearch -T 25 --domT 15 HMM DB

       The -T option specifies the whole sequence score in bits, and
       the --domT option specifies the per-domain threshold in bits.

  NC   Noise cutoff:

       This field refers to the bit scores of the highest scoring
       match not in the full alignment.

       An example NC line is shown below

       NC   19.50 18.10;

       As with the GA line, this field contains two numbers - the
       first number in the set refers to the highest whole sequence
       score in bits of a match not in the full alignment, and the
       second number specifies the highest per-domain score in bits of
       a match not in the full alignment.  These two scores may not
       refer to the same sequence.

  TC   Trusted cutoff:

       This field refers to the bit scores of the lowest scoring match
       in the full alignment.

       An example TC line is shown below

       TC   23.00 16.10;

       As with the GA line, this field contains two numbers - the
       first set refers to the lowest whole sequence score in bits of
       a match in the full alignment, and the second number specifies
       the lowest per-domain score in bits of a match in the full
       alignment.  These two scores may not refer to the same
       sequence.

  TP   Type field:                 Single word

       The type field is a compulsory field describing the type of
       family.  At present it can be one of:

       TP   Family
       TP   Domain
       TP   Repeat
       TP   Motif
       TP   Coiled-coil
       TP   Disordered

  PI   Previous IDs:               Semi-colon list

      The most recent names are stored on the left.  This field is
      non-compulsory.

  SQ   Sequence:               Number of sequences, start of alignment.

  //                           End of alignment





  The alignment is in Stockholm format.  This includes mark-ups of four
  types:

     #=GF <featurename> <Generic per-File annotation, free text>
     #=GC <featurename> <Generic per-Column annotation, exactly 1 char per column>
     #=GS <seqname> <featurename> <Generic per-Sequence annotation, free text>
     #=GR <seqname> <featurename> <Generic per-Sequence AND per-Column mark up, exactly 1 char per column>

  Recommended placements:

     #=GF Above the alignment
     #=GC Below the alignment
     #=GS Above the alignment or just below the corresponding sequence
     #=GR Just below the corresponding sequence

  The alignment formats have the following size limits:

     <aligned sequence>: max 4096 characters.
     <seqname>: max 50 characters.
     <featurename> max 50 characters.

  These details can also be found on the web, see URL:

     http://sonnhammer.sbc.su.se/Stockholm.html

  Structural mark ups are provided by MGnifam.  For each sequence of
  known structure we provide #=GR lines with featurenames SS
  for secondary structure. For the whole family we provide
  consensus #=GC lines with feature names SS_cons.
