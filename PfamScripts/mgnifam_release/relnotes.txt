MGNIFAM: A database of metagenomic protein sequence alignments and profile-HMMs 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. INTRODUCTION

   MGnifam is a collection of metagenomic protein sequence alignments
   and profile hidden Markov models (HMMs).

2. LOCATION

   MGnifam is available on the web at:


3. CONSTRUCTION OF MGNIFAM

   MGnifam is based on metagenomic protein sequences from the MGnify resource
   
   MGnify can be accessed at:

   https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics/


4. DESCRIPTION OF RELEASE FILES

   README                  - A brief description on how to use the MGnifam HMM library
