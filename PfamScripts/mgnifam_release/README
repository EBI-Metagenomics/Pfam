MGnifam
=======

MGnifam is a collection of metagenomic profile-HMMs which 
are based on protein sequences from the MGnify resource [1][2].
The profile-HMMs are built using the HMMER3 software [3].

How to use MGnifam
==================

The protein alignments that the MGnifam profile-HMMs are built from can be 
found in the file MGnifam.seed. The library of HMMs that were created from 
these alignments can be found in the file MGnifam.hmm.

To use the MGnifam HMM library you must first index files with the following 
command:

  hmmpress MGnifam.hmm

To search MGnifam against a set of sequences you run the following command:

  hmmsearch --cut_ga MGnifam.hmm seqs.fasta
